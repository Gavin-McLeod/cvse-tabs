# cvse-tabs

Holding and sharing repo for proofing tabs for the cvse "what's new" feature.

Just a place to store, version, and share some quick proof-of-concept work.
Reference should be made to the Bootstrap documentation for javascript tabs here: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tabs

Attempt to find a Bootstrap driven solution to the problems associated with the current "What's New" page of the CVSE site.
* Primary content navigation should still be tabs
* Secondary navigation can be anything reasonable but drop-down navigation is suggested
* The solution should realise 3 primary goals
    * clean up the navigation visually -- drop-downs may help, but may also remove user intuition by hiding navigation options
    * material should be reachable through a URL
	* tables should allow the user to sort their data by column
                             
### Current features of this sampler

* Bootstrap based
* Tabbed primary navigation -- see the [Bootstrap Tabs](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tabs) documentation
* menued secondary navigation
	* all content accessible through the URL using a querystring
	* sortable tables - at least one acceptable solution, but there may be others.  See https://github.com/drvic10k/bootstrap-sortable

Also:  This page uses the CSS file from the CMS, almost as documented.
